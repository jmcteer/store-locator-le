Store Locator Plus works with Google Maps v3 to put a store location search on your site.
The most active store locator plugin.

== Description ==

Whether you have a thousands of locations or just a handful, you can do it all from within the WordPress admin panel. No programming required, no monthly fee to ask questions in the forum and an active development team supporting you. Set up an interactive Google map for your customers with a single shortcode. Categorize your stores and customize the map. You can export the results. This is a simple, quick, and easy plugin.

Store Locator Plus is an advanced system for managing multiple physical locations via a fully integrated WordPress solution. You can add details such as a store description, hours, a website address, an email address, and tags for each location and then display those locations easily on any page using a shortcode. The location search form and Google Map will automatically be displayed.

Advanced customization is available via the settings interface in the admin panel. The map can be customized via the admin panel to fit better on your site by allowing for different sizes, map types (terrain, satellite, standard views), and default location settings. The search form can be customized to show or hide a country pulldown, a city and state pulldown, and tag search fields. You can also re-label every entry field and can opt to enable pop-up email forms to help reduce spam.

= Our Philosophy =

Like all of our plugins, we strive to create code the runs efficiently and without bugs. We feel well-written plugins are few and far between. While there are plenty of plugins that look nice, far too many of those plugins, including the "cool shiny ones" have way to many hidden problems. We have found that over 90% of the plugins available on the WordPress plugin directory generate dozens, if not hundreds, of warnings and errors when we turn off the "hide all the problems" settings in PHP.

These hidden problems impact memory usage, fill up disk space, and reduce performance via the typical default logging settings on most web hosts. While you may not see the errors on your WordPress site, they are still being tracked. The more errors, the more disk I/O, the slower the app.

During our 20+ years of software development, we have also found that leaving "innocuous" warnings in place tends to lead to trouble further down the road. Warnings today often become errors tomorrow. Many programming languages, PHP included, continue to tighten security and close loopholes that are typically found living near all those warning messages. Some warnings are also telling you to "change this now, it will be gone tomorrow". Eventually tomorrow will come.

While our plugins may not be the prettiest on the block, we do try to make sure that all the hidden stuff you don't see is designed as well as it can be. To sum it all up, we like to write plugins that last. We hope you appreciate our work.

= New! Store Pages =

You can have a WordPress page for each store location on your map turning your location data into SEO friendly content.  Store Pages are a special page type that is fully integrated with WordPress,  but you manage them through Store Locator Plus.  Store Pages also have their own taxonomy (category system) so you can manage Store Page categories without affecting the rest of your site.

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* PHP 5.1+
* Wordpress: 3.3.2+

= Main Plugin =

1. Upload the `store-locator-plus` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Sign up for a Google Maps API Key for your domain at http://code.google.com/apis/console/
4. Add your locations through the 'Add Locations' page in the Store Locator admin panel
5. Place the code '[STORE-LOCATOR]' (case-sensitive) in the body of a page or a post to display your store locator

= Icons =

The system ships with a dozen default icons in the `/wp-content/plugins/store-locator-le/core/images/icons` directory. Add your own custom icons in that directory and they will be auto-detected.

= Custom Styling =

Users that want to customize the look and feel of the search form, map, and search results can do so
with ease using the new Theme System that is part of the Pro Pack.   Copy an existing CSS file,
change the file name and update the CSS header, upload to the server and you can now activate your
new theme or any of the built-in defaults by selecting it from the auto-generated pulldown menu.

Be sure to send us your custom theme CSS file and we'll include it in the next release!   We'll also list you here in our upcoming credits section!

Users that opt not to purchase the Pro Pack can still customize the look by editing the basic CSS file that ships with the free plugin.

= Attribution and Credits =

Thanks to [Nicolas Mollet](http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com/) for some of the great icons.

== Installation ==

= Requirements =

* PHP 5.1+

= Main Plugin =

1. Upload the `store-locator-plus` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Sign up for a Google Maps API Key for your domain at http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html
4. Add your locations through the 'Add Locations' page in the Store Locator admin panel
5. Place the code '[STORE-LOCATOR]' (case-sensitive) in the body of a page or a post to display your store locator

= Icons =

1. There are some default icons in the `/wp-content/plugins/store-locator/icons` directory. 
2. Add your own custom icons in to `wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-icons`.

= Custom CSS (Stylesheet) =

You can modify the default style sheet included with the plugin at 
./css/csl-slplus.css' and place it under `/wp-content/uploads/sl-uploads/custom-css/`. 
The store locator will give priority to the 'csl-slplus.css' in the 'custom-css/' 
folder over the default 'csl-slplus.css' file that is included.  This allows you 
to upgrade the main store locator plugin without worrying about losing your 
custom styling.
